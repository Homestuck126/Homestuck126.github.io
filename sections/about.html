  <p>
    Greetings, traveler! I'm <strong>Aaron Tam</strong> — a computer science adventurer
    who thrives at the crossroads of distributed systems, AI wizardry, and
    large-scale engineering.
  </p>

  <p>
    I enjoy designing systems that are fast and resilient. Whether I'm building custom schedulers for Knative,
    optimizing MoE model orchestration, or digging into kernel behavior with eBPF,
    I love uncovering how things work under the hood.
  </p>

  <p>
When I’m not casting code spells, you’ll find me tinkering with new tech, exploring fantasy RPG worlds, or running experiments in Google Colab. I thrive on task-based programming—building components that fit seamlessly into larger systems—and I’m always excited to learn something new.
  </p>

  <p>
    My current quest: blending distributed systems and LLMs to build the next
    generation of intelligent, fault-tolerant AI systems.
